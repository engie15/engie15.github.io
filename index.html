          <p>Kia ora! Engie here (pronounced like the letters N, G - you got it!). 
             With pretty much zero ‘actual real life’ coding or programming experience, my goal is to spend the next 10 years building my skills to become a full stack developer.
          </p>
          <p>Why Full Stack?  Because I want to have the means to be able to take an idea and bring it into creation through digital technology.  
             I understand that becoming a Full Stack Developer is not a destination but a journey and that brings me to where I am today – an Enspiral Dev Academy (EDA) student and my Te Ururangi journey.  Tōku haerenga Te Ururangi. 
             Follow me and read about how a 30 year old Māori and CookIsland woman tackles her full immersive learning experience with EDA and takes her first step into te ao hangarau mamati.
