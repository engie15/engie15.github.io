      <br/> My Te Ururangi Journey</h1>
    
    <p class="para1">
       Kia ora! Engie here (pronounced like the letters N, G - you got it!). 
       <br/>With pretty much zero ‘actual real life’ coding or programming experience, my goal is to spend the next 10 years building my skills to become a full stack developer.  
    </p>
    <p class="para1">    
       <br/>Why Full Stack?  Because I want to have the means to be able to take an idea and bring it into creation through digital technology.  
       <br/>Now, knowing where I want to be is easy enough – getting there is another story. 
       <br/>I’m 30 and where others are settling into their careers – I’m starting mine in a totally new field.
       <br/>Where most my age are expected to have a house, partner, the finances in check – well I have an amazing partner and family who supports me in what I set out to do.  I’m moving from Melbourne back to my hometown Wellington to live with my whanau to pursue my dream - I’m pretty darn lucky if I must say so myself.
    </p>
    <p class="para1">
       I understand that becoming a Full Stack Developer is not a destination but a journey and that brings me to where I am today – an Enspiral Dev Academy (EDA) student and my Te Ururangi journey.  Tòku haerenga Te Ururangi.  This is my beginning.  
       <br/>Feel free to follow me and read about how a 30 year old Màori and CookIsland woman tackles her full immersive learning experience with EDA and takes her first step into te ao hangarau mamati.
