            <h3>How does life look through the ‘pleasure, passion and purpose’ lens?
            </h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                I am fit toned and strong where I eat to safely and naturally heal my body.  I train to move and 
                strengthen my body.  I have the means to work from where ever I may be, a digital nomad where all I  
                need is my laptop and internet connection.  I can travel the world at a drop of a hat.  Where ever 
                my heart desires I can go there and experience the world wholeheartedly.<br>
                <br>
                I am my own boss.  I run a company of my own and our people love what they do and have passion to do 
                what is right and I enable them to be and become the best versions of themselves which ensures my 
                business grows genuinely and authentically.  I don’t have my own office.  I don’t need it.  I work 
                with my team on the floor where although I wear the hat of ‘Founder/Director’ the way I run my business 
                is by making efficient, well informed evidence-based decisions with my team and surround myself with the best 
                minds in areas that are their strengths and bring balance and diversity to the team.<br>
                <br>
                My company provides tangible, effective quality solutions to a diverse range community issues.  Always 
                building from the ground up.  Looking for ways to build employment for communities in ways that draw on 
                their skills.  Based in NZ, Ideally, I want to begin working with Maori to create an inclusive future where we can build a path 
                to live to our full potential and are not divided by our differences but we are accepting of them.<br>
                <br>
                I am financially strong.  I earn a strong solid passive income that means I no longer have to work although 
                I choose too on projects that have meaning and heart.<br>
                <br>
                Aaron and I live in our own home and care for each other.  Surrounded by natural light surrounded with 
                trees, nature and never far from the sea.  Our own little Oasis. We have a state of the art efficient home.  Solar powered and 
                collects rain water.  Small and compact so that we have no waste, we horde no junk and rubbish we have 
                want we need.  We have a garden full of veges and fruit.  With an entertainment section of our own 
                connected by a veranda walkway that makes it easy to walk between the different compact homes that can 
                be adjusted to moved with ease so we always have space for all whanau and friends to come visit or live 
                with us.<br>

              <p class="blog-content">
                I stand strong for the right to live a life that I choose.  I stand strong for equal opportunities for all no 
                matter your background, your race, or financial status.  I believe in creating equal opportunities to enable 
                all the opportunity to live the life they choose.  I stand for creating my own financial freedom in a way that 
                enables my community – rather than in competition.

            <h3>How did I find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                I absolutely love the resilience ideas but really need the practice executing them.  I reflected a lot over the 
                ideas and about how different I would have been if I had this training back when I was playing competitive national 
                and international sport.  I know I’ll need to practicing this especially as I head into our intensive part of our 
                study.  My meditation practice has fallen off the bandwagon a bit.  With the move to NZ I had many other things I 
                needed the time to work through and was exhausted the rest of the time.  Small steps – reset and start again.
