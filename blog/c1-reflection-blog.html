            <h3>What's your take on the EDA experience?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                Simply put for me, the EDA experience has the potential to be life changing.  To learn in Phase 0 and Bootcamp what
                it will take to become an entry level web and app developer is both exciting and daunting.  The only one who can
                hold me back from taking full advantage of learning with EDA is me.  I aim to give it my all so regardless of the
                outcome, I will know what I need to do to moved forward once I am done.
              </p>
            
            <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                My impressions of EDA are:
                <ul class="content">
                      <li class="content">It has the look and feel of a fun and hands-on environment.</li>
                      <li class="content">The people are awesome!</li>  
                      <li class="content">Great Kitchen (Wellington Campus).</li>
                      <li class="content">It's not going to be easy, there's a lot of work to be done.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
  
            <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                If everyone is as warm and engaging as Jack and Rohan – I know we are in good hands.  I believe in EDA’s mission. 
                Having worked across the public, private and social sector in a range of different work place cultures, I’m 
                interested to see how EDA puts it all into practice.  I’m ready to give what I can to the team and help cultivate 
                and foster a culture of integrity, kindness and effort with a healthy dose of laughter.
              </p>
        
            <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                Nope, if anything it has exceeded my expectations (so far) and I’m not even in Bootcamp yet.  I underestimated 
                how much mahi there is and how hard it is going to be.  I’ve appreciated how the EDA crew have kept me grounded 
                from admissions to getting into Phase 0.  They’re ‘keeping it real’ giving me realistic advice on milestones to 
                aim for and timeframes to set.  I get a real sense of genuine-ness and they are doing what they can to set us up 
                for success.
              </p>
        
            <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                On one side, I’m 110% excited and this is the kind of learning environment I tend to thrive in!  On the other side, 
                I’m nervous as (beep)!  I’m going to have to work through my ‘Imposter syndrome’ tendencies and make sure I build 
                great habits from the start and truly trust in the process.  As this is the start of my Te Ururangi journey and my 
                overall journey to becoming a Full Stack Developer. Mum always said “Baby girl, if you start something you better finish…”  
                That’s exactly what I set out to do.
