    <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
    <p>
        I’m a huge believer in the power of habits.  I read Charles Duhigg’s book, The Power of Habit in 2010 and it has had a power influence over my life.  Since making my commitment to study with EDA in 2018 and to ensure I balance my commitments to full time work and Phase 0 study, I’ve looked at building habits based on what I need to do to ensure I have quality sleep, nutrition and exercise.  The three areas I tend to neglect when I am busy or stressed.
        I used to do everything big!  But with limited time on my hands I’ve taken the tiny habits approach to incorporate three habits in my life over the coming month of January:    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>After my first alarm in the morning, I will do my two-minute plank.  (This I have started on boxing day).</li>
        <li>After I finish dinner, I will set out my clothes for gym and work. (This I have started today).</li>
        <li>After my 9pm alarm, I will finish what I am doing and start winding down for sleep.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
    <p>
     Something I have found interesting is now, when I feel when my mind is starting to wander off task I know it is time to have a break.  I listen to my body and see if it needs water, food or simply to take a break away from the task at hand.  Before I used to push and push and push until I was so hoha (annoyed) with what I was doing I no longer had the motivation to do it or through sheer frustration was too stubborn not to finish.  I’ve come to realise that taking a quick break to either eat, drink, walk or talk to someone can give me a renewed energy to get back to focussing on the task again.  (Who knew!)  
    </p>

    <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
    <p>
     The tiny habits have really worked for me.  I realised now that the ‘go big’ approach worked for the kind of lifestyle I had when the approached did work for me.  I have changed since then and now I realise that I the way need to re-create new habits needed to change too.
    </p>

    <h3>What will you experiment further with?</h3>
    <p>
     I want to experiment more with practicing mindfulness and meditation.  My mind is constantly going 100 miles an hour.  The next three tiny habits I aim to create will build towards my goal of having a daily mindfulness/meditation practice.
