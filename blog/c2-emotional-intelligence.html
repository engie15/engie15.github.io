              <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
                <p class="blog-content">
                  A lot of the learnings in chapter one reinforced a lot of what I know and have experienced about emotional 
                  intelligence.  To be honest as I was reading through the chapter I was reflecting more on my current state of <abbr title="Emotional Intelligence">EQ</abbr>,
                  how strong my <abbr title="Emotional Intelligence">EQ</abbr> was and why certain positive habits are no longer a part of my life.  In reading this chapter 
                  and reflecting over my past year (which was a real year of change for me), rather figuratively beat myself for not maintaining  
                  things it’s helped me become more understanding and kind towards myself.   I never had a daily 
                  practice of mindfulness and I believe that is the lesson for me. Build one.  This is where I am and with time and mindfulness 
                  practice – I can rebuild the level <abbr title="Emotional Intelligence">EQ</abbr> I had, surpass it and develop it into my way of being.
                </p>
            <h3>How was my first practice of two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                I went into my two minutes open to moving between the Easy way and Easier way – which ever felt right during the session.  
                I started in easier way and to be honest with the noises and happenings in my house at that time I kept finding my focus 
                distracted.   So I switched to Easy Way and focused on my breath and I did feel moments of purely being and then ‘bing’ – my 
                two minutes were up.
                I really enjoyed it and will make that my next tiny habit to incorporate next week – two minutes of mindfulness before I go 
                to bed.
