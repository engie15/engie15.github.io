            <h3>What is a responsive site and why is responsiveness important?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                A responsive site is a website that can adjust its content, structure and design to suit the screen size of your user.
                Responsiveness is important because more of the public are using smart phones and or mobile devices to search 
                the web.  This means, as a web developer you want to make sure the site you are creating is as functional and visually 
                engaging on the small screen, as it would be on a bigger laptop or computer screen and vice versa.
              </p>
            <h3>What is mobile first design and why is it important?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                Mobile first design is where a web developer will design a website for a small/smartphone screen first and from this 
                point, develop the site to suit bigger screens.  
                Think about a time where you are browsing the web on your phone looking for information or searching for a restaurant 
                website.  You click on it, only to find you can’t read or find the menu.  This is not a good experience for a potential 
                customer now is it?
                Ensuring an exceptional user/customer experience is why it is important to utilise the mobile first approach when you
                are creating a website.  You will know exactly how a website looks and works for a user regardless of the type of device 
                they are using.
              </p>
            <h3>What are frameworks and their pros and cons?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                Think of a framework as a prepared website template written in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and 
                <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> coding that a web developer can take and use to create their website.  
                A web developer can literally cut and paste a framework into their coding tool to see how the framework looks and works, 
                then adapt the website to suit their look.
              </p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="six columns">
               <h6>PROS:</h6>
                <ol>
                    <li>Saves a web developer time when using a framework instead of starting from scratch.</li>
                    <li>You can learn new styles by finding and using different frameworks.</li>
                    <li>Even when using a framework, you can still tailor the design and structure of your website to suit your needs and taste.</li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <div class="six columns">
               <h6>CONS:</h6>
                <ol>
                    <li>You have to learn all the ‘class types’ to effectively know how to change anything on a framework.</li>
                    <li>You can ruin the entire structure of a page by adding other elements (speaking from experience,this can take some time to 
                        figure out what went wrong).</li>
                    <li>(Following on from point #2) It can actually be easier to build a site from scratch rather than using a framework.</li>
                </ol>

            <h3>What is a wireframe and why do we use it?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                A wireframe is a full basic diagram of how you want a webpage to look.  This can be drawn by hand or created electronically.  
                A wireframe is created before you begin developing and designing your website.  It gives you a high-level plan so as you are 
                building your webpages, if you find you're getting lost in the detail – your wireframe guides you back to the basics.

            <h3>What aspects of my wireframe did I find difficult to implement and why?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                I found creating the navigation bar on the top of my page was a real struggle.  It took me awhile to figure it out as
                I wasn't aware of the right framework classes to use to ensure it was responsive.  When I found one solution, I came across 
                errors when I was updating the rest of my blog.  I know how to now but it was a frustrating process to go through but I'm
                grateful for the learning experience.
