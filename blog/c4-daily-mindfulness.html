            <h3>What did I learn from my ‘mindfulness conversation’? How did the other person find it?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                Interesting enough I did this exercise with my partner and it has made us both aware of our own behaviours when it comes to being 
                mindful listeners and or conversers.
                From my partners perspective, he liked that in the whole 3 minutes he was talking he had my attention the whole time.  I wasn’t 
                busy doing something or on my phone.  He had my full attention.  
                From my perspective, I saw my partner struggle to give me his full attention for the 3 minutes.  As I was speaking I can see him 
                looking at the timer or looking around the room.  Having a formal mindfulness conversation together has given us a behaviour we can 
                both work on individually to be more engaged in our relationship and aware of how our actions affect the other person.   I appreciate 
                that we are walking away with far more insight into ourselves than we intended.

            <h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                I will remember "have expectations before meditation but no expectations during meditation" from the lightness and joy meditation
                technique, but the one I will use is the Meditation Circuit Training Technique.  This resonated with me given my background in 
                sport.  So I'll start small with two sets of 90sec intervals of focused mediation and open meditation and 1 minute of breathing 
                at the start and end of each session.

                Given my week, this quote is going to be my mantra for the rest of Phase 0:
                  <blockquote cite="Search Inside Yourself Author">“If you understand the process, you may understand that when change does come, it 
                      will come suddenly, and every moment of effort brings you a little closer to that point.”</blockquote>
