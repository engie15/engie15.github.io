            <h3>When programming, what are some of your triggers?  What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                One of my triggers when programming is when my problem-solving methods do not work (and yet have worked up 
                until this point).  The sheer frustration, then anger, then blame, then fear all begin to cycle its way through 
                my head.<br>
                <br>To be honest, another trigger is when I see others in my cohort who started at the same time as me moving 
                through Sprints and finishing Sprints faster than me.  When I see a slack request for Sprints or blogs being 
                posted, knowing I’m behind causes feelings of envy and self-depreciation and doubt kick in.  I know part of it 
                is because of my competitive side.    I want to do, be my best and give it my all and when I am and still I can’t 
                seem to move past (trigger number one) a task in a Sprint causes the feelings of envy and self depreciation and 
                doubt.
                This is where the section on “Do not feel bad about feeling bad” was really good for me to meditate on.  I do let 
                my ego go in some situations and I know it works but it doesn’t always happen in ALL situations where it’s 
                needed.  I’m looking forward to building my practice to be able to consistently recognise and apply these techniques.        
              </p>
            <h3>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                I found the Siberian North Railroad exercise calming to be honest.  I’m generally a calm person in my most heated 
                moments so this was great to do.  What I found interesting is of all the steps:  Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect 
                and Respond – the steps I don’t do well in real time is the ‘Notice’ and ‘Respond’ parts of this exercise.  For the 
                ‘Notice’ part I don’t recognise where in my body I’m feeling different emotions when they arise.  The ‘Respond’ step 
                I find interesting because I’ve been raised if you have nothing nice to say don’t say anything at all but there are 
                some situations the need me to speak so visualizing how I would is going to give me some great practice for when and if 
                it happens in real time.
