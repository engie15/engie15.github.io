            <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
            <p>Our eyes follow patterns when we look at a page.  We will look at a page left to right, then start reading down the page.  For web developers, the grid based design utilizes this pattern to display/design a web page.</p>
            
            <h3>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
            <p>More and more users will browse the internet on their smartphones or tablets rather than use a 
                <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> or laptop.  That means we need to make sure we have responsive webpages to cater to the different screens a user would use to scroll through your website.  
                A responsive webpage is all about the resolution.  As we create webpages, we can utilise certain rules and syntax’s in 
                <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>and 
                <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> where regardless of what type of device you use or even if the page is resized, it will continue to be engaging and user friendly.</p>

            <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
            <p>Sematic structure is the way you structure your 
                <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document so that it is clear and easy for a computer to read.  </p>

            <h3>Any points I found interesting and want to reflect on?</h3>
            <p>Google fonts is my new best friend! I really want to delve into getting practical in using media queries and begin to build habits around how to em’s or % instead of pixels for example but I’m not sure I have been using it correctly.   I’m getting my head around the box model after Udacity Lesson 2 but I’m still not 100% confident on it.  All in good time.</p>
