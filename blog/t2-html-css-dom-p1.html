            <h3>Describe an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, 
                <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and 
                <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> analogy:
            </h3>
            <p>
                <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
                is the language of the internet.  It uses open and close tags to create instructions (syntaxs) which are governed by rules to create content and structure of a webpage.  Where <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is responsible for the content and structure of a webpage, 
                <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is the language responsible for the look and style of a webpage.  In 
                <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, we can change the font color or size to what suits the eye.  You can add a background color and style the heading of the page so it stands out from the rest.  All webpage design and layout is done through using 
                <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now how is this all then translated into a webpage that our general population see every day?
            </p>
            <p>    
                To search the web we all use a browser.  I like Google Chrome there is also Firefox or Internet Explorer for example.  It is through the 
                <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> (a 
                <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> interprets and represents 
                <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> for the internet), that a browser knows how and what to present – which is what we see on a webpage.  I think an analogy for the 
                <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> is a fashion designer.  A designer interprets a dress pattern, takes the selected material and sews a gorgeous gown.

            <h3>What is Boxifying Design?</h3>
            <p>
                Boxifiying design is when you break up a design for a web page into boxes.
                Every element of a page can be treated as a box.  <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> works in boxes.  The Internet works in boxes.  A circle is a box, when it come to the internet.  Boxifying design allows a web developer to work out an underlying structure of a page in order to replicate or create a web page design.
            </p>

            <h3>What is the Box Model?</h3>
            <p>
                The Box Model describes what makes up a box on a webpage and is usually the next process to follow once you have completed boxifying a design.
                Imagine a box with outer 3 layers.  The centre of the box is the content.  The 1st layer (surrounding the content) is the padding, the 2nd layer is the border, with the 3rd most outer layer of the box is called the margin. Each layer can have its own thickness and the thickness can differ from the top, right, bottom or left of a box.
