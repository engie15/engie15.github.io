            <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                I had a love hate relationship with the process over product concept.  I absolutely loved the process of wireframes to build, 
                then to design.  It was great to have in mind what I wanted my site redesign to look like.  Where I struggled was with the design.  
                Being new, my skills are limited and what I wanted to create I don’t have the skill to do (yet).  This is what made me spend more 
                time on certain details I wanted to figure out how to create and being persistent as I know I can be – this took a lot of my time.  
                To manage this, I used the time-blocking technique for each session where I was working on the redesign.  This helped immensely.  
                I found myself going back to my wireframe constantly because I would get side tracked into wanting to learn a different skill that 
                wasn’t a part of my wireframe.  It acted like my reset button.  
              </p>
              <p class="blog-content">
                The funny thing is, once I let go of the frustration and looked at my website with fresh eyes – I slightly adjusted my redesign 
                vision and ‘Boom!’.  Suddenly I had a burst of creativeness within the realm of skills I know and have to finally complete the 
                design component.
                I had set 10 hours as my overall time block for this task and although I went over the total hours, the learning I had in those 
                needed extra hours I’m grateful for.  
              </p>
            <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                I’m a believer of Meditation, I’m currently working on building a daily meditation practice.  My mind is constantly on and I 
                have always wanted to know how can I give my mind a moment of peace.  An opportunity to rest.  This is what lead me to having 
                an open mind about meditation all together.  
              </p>
            <h3>What new things have I learnt about meditation?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                Because I’ve learnt so many new things about meditation, I want to touch on the three that stood out to me most:
              </p>
              <div class="row">
                  <div class="one column">
                      <p></p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="nine columns">
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        The Four Step Plan to working with Distraction – mind blowing.  Including meditation, I know of multiple ways I can 
                        actually apply this to my day to day living.  #putitintopractice   
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Increase in immunity – having the ability to heal yourself from within.  Like WOW! 
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The spirit of inquiry.  Reading over this chapter this part stood out to me most.  To me, the spirit of inquiry is how 
                        I have come to where I am today.  I’m on the search on how to do certain things, how to learn certain skills, why do 
                        people do this and others that, why do things happen in this way – I mean I ask these questions (mostly to myself and 
                        at times to others) and if I don’t know – I seek out the answer in whatever way, shape or form.  To know that meditation 
                        is a way to look in yourself and answer from within has me excited about what I am going to learn about myself.  
                        (I sound like such a geek.  I love it!)
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                  </div>  
                  <div class="one column">
                        <p></p>
                  </div>
              </div>
            <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                Yes.  I’m going to attempt to look at using Intention and applying the Four Step Plan to working with distraction in my daily 
                practice.  I’ve already started using mindfulness when I have physical distractions (e.g an itch).  This has helped me to identify 
                what needs seeing to now and what doesn’t.  I can usually will an itch away now whereas before – I would just get to it.   I’m 
                also going to bump up to three minutes because I find now when my two minute buzzer goes off I don’t want it to end yet.
