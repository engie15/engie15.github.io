            <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                The relationship between self-awareness and mindfulness is that one can be practiced in retrospect 
                and present state (self-awareness) and the other focuses holistically on the present (mindfulness).  
                The wonderful thing is both are skills that can be learned and harnessed through genuine practice.  
              </p>
              <p class="blog-content">
                I reflected a lot on this chapter and I realised over the years I’ve become more self-aware with no 
                formal practice whereas mindfulness is a skill comes to me in a social setting but when I’m on my own 
                I need to put effort in to learn and develop this skill.  I resonated most with the point about Ego.  
                The Maori proverb above is one of the values my parents and whanau instilled in me growing up so  
                I recognise myself when Cheng shared about letting his ego become small, humble and mostly irrelevant 
                while focussing on kindness.
              </p>
              <p class="blog-content">
                What was an absolute gem of information being the point of letting my ego grow.  This is not about 
                letting my ego grow to make sure others in the room knew of my superiority, but letting it grow so 
                that I am unintimidated by whomever I am interacting with and continue to bring kindness and benefit 
                to others.  I have never thought of it in this way until now.  This I must practice.  For so long now I would 
                just keep eating that humble pie and remain in the letting my ego become small space – where situations 
                needed me to lean in to conversations so that I was unintimidated.  This is a technique I can actually 
                apply!! A – mazing!

          <h3>Try at least one of the self-awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journalling).  What was 
            your experience of it?  How did you feel?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                  I used to keep a journal religiously when I was younger especially in my college years.  (I stopped 
                  because my sister found my diary once, read it and showed it to her friends.  Siblings.  You got to 
                  love them.)  Now. I use journaling when I’m going through intense feelings.  If I’m confused about 
                  something, I’ll write it down and the great thing about it is there is no judgement and I gain the 
                  clarity I need to work through things. 
              </p>
          </div>
          <h3>What did I take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                  Last year, I started seeing a counsellor to work through an intense personal experience and during 
                  those sessions I delved into overwhelming and intense feelings.  It was during those sessions that I 
                  had the life-changing realisation that I am not my emotions.  My emotions are not me.  I am learning 
                  to listen to my feelings and acknowledge them to let them go or if there are more underlying issues 
                  that need to be addressed then working through them.  Feelings are not permanent but my body's way 
                  of telling something, so keep listening.  Reading this again is the perfect reminder that I have plenty 
                  more to learn and practice to really build a daily practice.
