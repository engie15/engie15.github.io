            <h3>...got blocked on a simple problem.</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                I was working through the codeAcademy JavaScript course (as a part of Sprint 5) and I was stuck on the 
                question 16 where I needed to create an alert.  I couldn’t move onto the next question until I had solved 
                this one (sigh). 
              </p>
              <p class="blog-content">
                I reset and rewrote the code multiple times to see if I had a dot in the wrong space or not – that didn’t work.
                I went over the last 3 course modules just in case I missed something – nope, nothing there.
                I went to Mozilla DN and read up on Alerts and syntax use to make sure it was all correct – correct syntax use 
                but nope – still didn’t work.
                The more I tried the more frustrated I become.  I realise now my internal dialogue wasn’t the greatest.  I 
                was worried about how much time it was taking me.  Then it spiralled into how far behind in the Sprints I was 
                compared to everyone else – etc. etc.  
              </p>
              <p class="blog-content">
                    So I bit the bullet and asked for help but decided to use the CodeAcademy forum rather than our EDA forum.  
                    I thought when I start coding on my own I’ll need to get used to asking for help from complete strangers so 
                    might as well start now.  I posted up and in 10 mins I had a response and realised I had a single space in 
                    the alert code that wasn’t supposed to be there.  
              </p>
              <p class="blog-content">     
                    e.g. <code>alert (“Hello World”);</code> =  wrong,  <code>alert(“Hello World”);</code> = correct.
              </p>
              <p class="blog-content">
                    I had to laugh out loud to myself.  Such a simple answer and you know what I know this isn’t going to be the 
                    last time this happens either.  So note to self – Remember: Pay attention to the finer details, BREATHE!, and 
                    go again.
              </p>
            <h3>...solved a problem in an elegant way.</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                    I was working on the Part 1 of 2 in the FizzBuzz exercise and up until this point I hadn’t really been writing 
                    JS code without help until now.
                    So I told myself no referring back to material, I was to use only what is inside my head to complete this task.  
                    Through sheer trial and error - woolah! I was able to execute the exercise and completed my first simple if, else 
                    if with no issues at all and it was right!
                    Knowing the heartache I was having with Sprint 4, executing this problem by myself was a mind blowing moment for 
                    me.  To be honest, I struggled through Part 2 of this exercise but the lessons for me were to make sure I celebrate 
                    my successes (no matter how small).
              </p>
            <h3>...reflected on how confident I feel using the problem-solving techniques and process.</h3>
              <p class="blog-content">
                    My 'go to' methods for problem solving is goggling, trying something, say it out loud or pseudocode, figure out using 
                    Dev tool and improving with reflection.  I can see the rubber ducking method coming in handy the more I learn about JS.  
                    Error messages haven’t really worked for me except for when I’m working in terminal.  I need to bring mindfulness 
                    to myself during the problem-solving process though.  There are points of absolute frustration I get to where I need 
                    to stop and breathe but I only realise AFTER it’s happened (Whoopsy).
